In this talk we look back over our 5-6 years of teaching Research Computing in
Earth Science to first-year graduate students in Columbia University's
Department of Earth and Environmental Science. We discuss the course content and
flow, the value of the Pangeo platform for teaching, assignments and grading,
data sources, and the class final projects. We also discuss some of the
pedagogical mechanics which we have found to work best in the teaching of this
material. The presentation ends with forward-looking questions about how this
course can be extended into the advanced realm.
