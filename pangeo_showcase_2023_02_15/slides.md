## Book (Content and Flow)
 - Taking students from Zero to Xarray
 - [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html)
 - Calendar


<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>
## Pedagogical Mechanics

 - Teaching first-year Earth science graduate students
 - Coding from scratch
 - Two monitors / computers
 - Go really slow!!!
 - Lecture days and collaborative time each week
 - Example session


<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>
## Platform

 - Pangeo ... Yes!
 - Easy to take Pangeo-like teaching platform for granted
 - The Great Miniconda/Conda Debacle of 2022


<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>
## Data: Too Real or Not Too Real?

 - Almost real ARGO data: [https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/numpy_matplotlib.html](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/numpy_matplotlib.html)
 - Real hurricane data from NOAA: [https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/pandas_groupby.html](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/pandas_groupby.html)
 - Real data is becoming harder to use because account requirements are becoming more common
 - (This trend is opposite of what Ryan and I have been advocating for many years!)
 - Currently real data is more of a problem for the instructors than the students


<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/>
## Data: Assignments, Grading, and Rubrics

 - Our assignments are pretty difficult!
 - [https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/more_xarray.html](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/more_xarray.html)
 - Rubrics are detailed but so far have not been made public
 - Rubric example

## Final Projects

 - Final projects are a highlight of the course and super fun
 - Students develop their own projects based on their scientific interest
