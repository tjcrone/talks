## Book (Content and Flow)

 - Used to teach Research Computing in Earth Science at Columbia University
 - First-year graduate students
 - Taking students from Zero to Xarray with Pangeo
 - [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html)
 - Lecture days and collaborative time each week
 - Calendar

## Pedagogical Mechanics

 - Teaching first-year Earth science graduate students
 - Coding from scratch -- The key to everything!!
 - Two monitor / computer system
 - Go really slow!!!
 - Example session


<br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/> <br/><br/>

## Platform

 - Pangeo ... Yes! [https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io/hub/login](https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io/hub/login)
 - Easy to take Pangeo-like teaching platform for granted
 - The Great Miniconda/Conda Debacle of 2022

## Data: Too Real or Not Too Real?

 - Almost real ARGO data: [https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/numpy_matplotlib.html](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/numpy_matplotlib.html)
 - Real hurricane data from NOAA: [https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/pandas_groupby.html](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/pandas_groupby.html)
 - Real data is becoming harder to use because account requirements are becoming more common
 - (This trend is opposite of what Ryan and I have been advocating for many years!)
 - Currently real data is more of a problem for the instructors than the students

## Data: Assignments, Grading, and Rubrics

 - Our assignments are pretty difficult!
 - [https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/more_xarray.html](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/assignments/more_xarray.html)
 - Rubrics are detailed but so far have not been made public
 - Rubric example

## Final Projects

 - Final projects are a highlight of the course and super fun
 - Students develop their own projects based on their scientific interest
 - [https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/projects.html](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/projects.html)
 - Projects are very advanced considering our starting point
 - [https://github.com/cjuang/rces-final-project/blob/main/rces-final-project.ipynb](https://github.com/cjuang/rces-final-project/blob/main/rces-final-project.ipynb)

## Next Steps

 - A follow-on advanced course is greatly needed
 - [https://github.com/tjcrone/advanced-earth-data-science-book/wiki/Topics-Brainstorm](https://github.com/tjcrone/advanced-earth-data-science-book/wiki/Topics-Brainstorm)
 - More community engagement welcomed!!
